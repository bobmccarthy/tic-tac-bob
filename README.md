# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project uses react to build a tic tac toe board for two players. I use the initial state to hold a lot of my changing variables. This helps update the page when something changes without having to refresh.

index.html
main.sass.css - compiled SASS file
main.js - using a compiler for ES2015
BoardTileComponent.js
